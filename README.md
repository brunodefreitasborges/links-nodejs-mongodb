# Links Repository and Redirects - MongoDB - NodeJS

A study utilizing three distinct technologies:
<br><br>
Front-End with Dynamic Pages using EJS.<br>
Back-End using NodeJS.<br>
Database using MongoDB.<br>

By applying these three, I created a repository for links, with the ability to add links, edit, delete and list them.

The redirect function allows us to create customized links that can be included everywhere.

And the added database with clicks counter is extremely useful for marketing ends.
